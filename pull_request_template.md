### Changes that modify the db structure

* [ ] Backwards compatibility: Users running the new code using an existing .disquetv folder will not lose their channels / settings.
* [ ] I've implemented the necessary db migration steps if any.

### New features

* [ ] I understand that the feature may not be accepted if it doesn't fit the upstream app's planned design direction. But that in this case I am encouraged to share this as an available modification other users can use if they want.
